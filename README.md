# CECS 327 - PeerToPeerNetwork Term Project 

The goal of this assignment is to become familiar with peer to peer (P2P)networks and having a client act as a server. You may work on this project in pairs.

Objective: 

Design a program which allows two or more computers to synchronize files across a local area network(LAN). 
Each computer should run its own local instance of the client software, and the files which will be synchronized should be able to be synchronized multidirectionally.
